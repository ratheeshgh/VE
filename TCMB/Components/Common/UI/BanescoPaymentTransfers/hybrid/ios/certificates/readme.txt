Code signing your app allows the operating system to identify who signed your app and to verify that your app hasn't been modified since you signed it.
Your app's executable code is protected by its signature because the signature becomes invalid if any of the executable code in the app bundle changes.

Apple Developer Program membership is required to request, download, and use signing certificates issued by Apple.
For more information on how to use signing certificates, review the App Distribution Guide and similar topics on the developer.apple.com website.
