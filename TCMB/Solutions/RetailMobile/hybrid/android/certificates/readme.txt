Android requires that all apps be digitally signed with a certificate before they can be installed.
Android uses this certificate to identify the author of an app, and the certificate does not need to be signed by a certificate authority.

Android apps often use self-signed certificates. The app developer holds the certificate's private key.
For more information on how to use certificates, review the App-Signing Guide and similar topics on the developer.android.com website.
